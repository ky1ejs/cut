# Adding annonymous users

## Why 
By removing a sign-up barrier to Cut, we give users the chance to engage with the app before committing.

## How
When a new device opens Cut, we'll register it with a new, anonymous, user.

At any time, the user can create a login for their account so that they may retrieve their data on another device.

## Downsides

### 1. Lost accounts
If a user forget to sign up, they may lose their data when they change device.

#### Remedy
We'll give the user gentle nudges after their first x sessions to create their account so they don't lose their data.

## Flow
1. App opens and checks for network connection (maybe we should have some intro screens so the user is guranteed to see at least something at startup)
2. App shows a loading screen, in which it's registering the device
3. App opens to main page
