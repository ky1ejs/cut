## Ideal features
1. Change log is uploaded with iOS build for current release (prev version number to current commit)
2. List changes in current version and previous version on iOS

## 2. Changelog on iOS

In order to do this we need to:
1. create a file on disk for the iOS build to include
2. cache previous version changelog, otherwise we'll need to build our entire history of changelogs
